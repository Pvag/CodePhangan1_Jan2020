// What to do
// ==========
// Re-create the code from CP021 (who pays the bill), CP022 (favourite colors),
// CP025 (restaurant names and number of tables), CP026 (draw a row of circles),
// CP027 (favourite fruits - contains HW), HW013 (the grid of circles we developed together in Week3Lesson1).
// Put each worked example in a separate file (e.g. if it is the first time that you are re-writing it, call it 'CP021a')
//
// How to do it
// ============
// First open the code already developed, read it, deeply understand what it does and how it does it.
// Then close the source file and try to re-implement the same behaviour without looking at
// the original file or, eventually, only looking back here and there, as less as possible - but do look, after some time
// that you have been trying to find the solution without success.
//
// I'll tell you more
// ==================
// If during your re-writing you had to go back and look at the solution too many times, I suggest you to repeat this process,
// starting over from a new, blank sketch, trying again to re-create the same code that you want to emulate.
// This will help you memorizing the syntax, getting good at solving that type of problem and also incorporating a development style.
// Don't think about re-creating the same code, but focus on re-creating the same behaviour.
// You don't have to learn my solutions by heart, in fact you are encouraged to find different solutions, if you can and prefer so.
// You need to get to the level where you feel comfortable enough in developing the code that does what you want it to do.

// Before writing the code
// =======================
// Carefully read the original code, understand what it does and how it does it, then write notes on a piece of paper.
// Draw a sketch, maybe the canvas if it helps you. Highlight critical parts and cool techniques that you enjoy in the
// original code. Make your mind clear about what your code needs to do. Then make a list of things that the code has to do.
// You can create the list in the form of many comments and then, under each line of comment, develop the required behaviour.
// When all of this is in place, you can start coding.

// Enjoy!
