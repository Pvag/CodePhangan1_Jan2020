// practice with PV016, multiple balls bouncing around the canvas
//
// first, understand how the version with a single bouncing ball (PV015) was implemented;
// try to re-write it on your own until you really get the logic and the implementation technique;
//
// now understand how the instructor has implemented PV016, the version with multiple bouncing balls;
// notice how the arrays were used to store info about position and velocity of all the balls;
// re-implement PV016 on your own;
// notice how easy it is to add 2 more bouncing balls to this sketch; do it!
//
// re-implement PV016 until it is really clear and you basically don't need to read
// the original code anymore, while writing your implementation
