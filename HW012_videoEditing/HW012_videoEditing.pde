// Take a look at the Processing page for the
// video library ( https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html )
// and experiment a bit, following the instructions on that page and the related functions.
// Start with a very simple example, learn how to load a video,
// play it, stop it, maybe using the "spacebar" to play/pause.
//
// Then you will be able to create all sorts of effects on the video, e.g. turning it
// into greyscale, from colors, or maybe giving it a green tint as "The Matrix", or any other
// effect you could like.
