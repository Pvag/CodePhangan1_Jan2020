// create a function that draws a circle that moves horizontally from left to right:
// whenever the circle reaches the right edge, it should keep going forward, until it disappears;
// meanwhile, another circle should show up from the left edge, growing from the left,
// as much as the first one is fading out to the right, giving the impression of a
// vertical wrap (like if the canvas was wrapped around a vertical axis).
// Then call the function inside draw.
