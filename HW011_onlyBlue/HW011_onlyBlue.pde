// Expanding on PV005, make a sketch that shuts off the red and the green
// color component from an image loaded from a file, leaving only the
// blue component. Do this checking the code in PV005 as least possible.
//
// Do the same leaving the red component only and then the green component
// only. Store the three images (only blue, only red, only green) in
// 3 different files.
//
// Modify the greyscale version so that it emphasizes the blue component,
// giving it some more priority in the color than the red and the green
// components.
